## 📥 Overview

anti-oom-processor is a memory-efficient CSV processing engine. It uses Node.js Streams and Backpressure to handle large files while keeping a low memory footprint. This means it can process files with over 1 million rows without crashing your system. The application also provides real-time progress updates through Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## ⚙️ Features

- **Efficient Memory Management**: Handles multi-gigabyte CSV files safely without running out of memory.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Monitors processing and updates you on the status continuously.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes rows in manageable batches for optimal performance.
- **Node.js Streams**: Utilizes modern stream processing techniques for effective data handling.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
